# algorithms_Part1
This is my work for the course of Algorithms Part1, which created by Princeton University.

The course was created by Princeton University, About this course: This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
